# Store Frontend

This project consists of building an online store, where the user can initially see all the products, can search for them, sort them in ascending or descending order and can also filter the products by category. In addition, the user can see the products with the discount applied in case they have a discount.

It is requested to build separately [backend](https://github.com/allisonvp/api-store) (REST API) and frontend (application that consumes it).

The Frontend is an online store (single-page application) developed with vanilla JavaScript that obtains data from the [Store API](https://api-store-seven.vercel.app/api/products).
